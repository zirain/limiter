                      Istio will interpret the short name based on the namespace of
                      the rule, not the service. A rule in the \"default\" namespace
                      containing a host \"reviews\" will be interpreted as \"reviews.default.svc.cluster.local\",
                      irrespective of the actual namespace associated with the reviews
